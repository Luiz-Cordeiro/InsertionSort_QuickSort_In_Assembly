## Insertion Sort and Quick Sort in assembly

The code is a assembly implementation of quicksort and insertion sort. The program should run with no problems on MARS 

## :interrobang: How to run :

- Once loaded in Mars, you can use the example file. You must insert the complete path - like this C:\Users\luizf\Desktop\test\InsertionSort_QuickSort_In_Assembly\example.txt - to the file with integer numbers separated by spaces. 

  If everything works fine, you'll receive the numbers inside the file in the output. After that, you must select with 1 (Insertion Sort) or 2 (Quick Sort). The ordered sequence should be shown and registered in the end of the same file.

## The Code is yours :smiley:

- Feel free to use this code as you want. I hope you can improve it. :rocket:

My best regards.
